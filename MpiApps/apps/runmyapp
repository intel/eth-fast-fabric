# script to perform a single run of an app.
# by having mpirun invoke this script as the app we have a chance to
# carefully control environment variables and check the output from the
# app for indications of errors

# this is a sample which you should edit to match the application you want to
# to run, the example is provided for HPL

# edit this if you have an alternate path to MPI libraries
# default to MPI used for build
MPICH_PREFIX=${MPICH_PREFIX:-`cat .prefix 2>/dev/null`}
. ./select_mpi	# default MPICH_PREFIX if necessary

# uncomment if you want to collect any core files
#ulimit -c unlimited

# uncomment if MPI libraries may be in a non-standard path
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MPICH_PREFIX/lib64/shared:$MPICH_PREFIX/lib/shared:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# This line can run your real application with appropriate arguments
#imb/IMB-MPI1 "$@"
