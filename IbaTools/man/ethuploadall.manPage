.TH ethuploadall 8 "Intel Corporation" "Copyright(C) 2020\-2022" "EFSFFCLIRG (Man Page)"
.SH NAME
ethuploadall


.PP
Copies one or more files from a group of hosts to this system. Since the file name is the same on each host, a separate directory on this system is created for each host and the file is copied to it. This is a convenient way to upload log files or configuration files for review. This tool can also be used in conjunction with ethdownloadall to upload a host specific configuration file, edit it for each host, and download the new version to all the hosts.
.PP

.B NOTE:
To copy files from this host to hosts in the cluster, use ethscpall or ethdownloadall. user@ style syntax cannot be used when specifying filenames.
