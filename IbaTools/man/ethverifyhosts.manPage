.TH ethverifyhosts 8 "Intel Corporation" "Copyright(C) 2020\-2022" "EFSFFCLIRG (Man Page)"
.SH NAME
ethverifyhosts


.PP
Verifies basic node configuration and performance by running FF\(ulHOSTVERIFY\(ulDIR/hostverify.sh on all specified hosts.
.PP

.B NOTE:
Prior to using ethverifyhosts, copy the sample file /usr/share/eth-tools/samples/hostverify.sh to FF\(ulHOSTVERIFY\(ulDIR and edit it to set the appropriate configuration and performance expectations and select which tests to run by default. On the first run for a given node, use the -c option so that hostverify.sh gets copied to each node.

.PP
FF\(ulHOSTVERIFY\(ulDIR defines both the location of hostverify.sh and the destination of the hostverify.res output file. FF\(ulHOSTVERIFY\(ulDIR is configured in the /etc/eth-tools/ethfastfabric.conf file.
.PP
A summary of results is appended to the FF\(ulRESULT\(ulDIR/verifyhosts.res file. A punchlist of failures is also appended to the FF\(ulRESULT\(ulDIR/punchlist.csv file. Only failures are shown on stdout.

.SH Syntax
ethverifyhosts [-kc] [-f  \fIhostfile\fR] [-u  \fIupload\(ulfile\fR] [-d  \fIupload\(uldir\fR]
.br

[-h  \fIhosts\fR] [-T  \fItimelimit\fR] [-F  \fIfilename\fR] [ \fItest\fR ...]
.SH Options

.TP 10
--help

Produces full help text.

.TP 10
-k

At start and end of verification, kills any existing hostverify or xhpl jobs on the hosts.

.TP 10
-c

Copies hostverify.sh to hosts first, useful if you have edited it.

.TP 10
-f \fIhostfile\fR

Specifies the file with hosts in cluster.
.br
Default is /etc/eth-tools/hosts.

.TP 10
-h \fIhosts\fR

Specifies the list of hosts to ping.

.TP 10
-u \fIupload\(ulfile\fR

Specifies the filename to upload hostverify.res to after verification to allow backup and review of the detailed results for each node. The default upload destination file is hostverify.res. If -u \[aq]\[aq] is specified, no upload occurs.

.TP 10
-d \fIupload\(uldir\fR

Specifies the directory to upload result from each host to. Default is uploads.

.TP 10
-T \fItimelimit\fR

Specifies the time limit in seconds for host to complete tests. Default is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

.TP 10
-F \fIfilename\fR

Specifies the filename of hostverify script to use. Default is /root/hostverify.sh.

.TP 10
\fItest\fR

Specifies one or more specific tests to run. See
.br
/usr/share/eth-tools/samples/hostverify.sh for a list of available tests.

.SH Examples
