.TH ethshowallports 8 "Intel Corporation" "Copyright(C) 2020\-2024" "EFSFFCLIRG (Man Page)"
.SH NAME
ethshowallports


.PP
Displays basic port state and statistics for all host nodes.
.PP

.B NOTE:
ethreport is more powerful Intel(R) Ethernet Fabric Suite FastFabric commands. For general fabric analysis, use ethreport with options such as -o errors and -o slowlinks to perform an efficient analysis of link speeds and errors.

.SH Syntax
ethshowallports [-p  \fIplane\fR] [-f  \fIhostfile\fR] [-h \[aq]\fIhosts\fR\[aq]]
.br

.SH Options

.TP 10
--help

Produces full help text.
.TP 10
-p \fIplane\fR

Specifies the name of the plane to use. Default is the first enabled plane defined in Mgt config file.
.TP 10
-f \fIhostfile\fR

Specifies the file containing the list of hosts in cluster. It overrides the HostsFile for the selected plane that is defined in Mgt config file.
.TP 10
-h \fIhosts\fR

Specifies the list of hosts for which to show ports.
.SH Environment Variables

.PP
The following environment variables are also used by this command:
.TP 10
\fBHOSTS\fR

List of hosts, used if -h option not supplied.

.TP 10
\fBHOSTS\(ulFILE\fR

File containing list of hosts, used in absence of -f and -h.

.TP 10
\fBFABRIC\(ulPLANE\fR

Name of fabric plane used in absence of -p, -f, and -h.

.SH Example
ethshowallports
.br

ethshowallports -p plane1
.br

ethshowallports -h \[aq]elrond arwen\[aq]
.br

HOSTS=\[aq]elrond arwen\[aq] ethshowallports
.br


.SH Notes

.PP
When performing ethshowallports against hosts, internally SSH is used. The command ethshowallports requires that password-less SSH be set up between the host running the Intel(R) Ethernet Fabric Suite FastFabric Toolset and the hosts ethshowallports is operating against. The ethsetupssh FastFabric tool can aid in setting up password-less SSH.
