.TH ethdownloadall 8 "Intel Corporation" "Copyright(C) 2020\-2022" "EFSFFCLIRG (Man Page)"
.SH NAME
ethdownloadall


.PP
Copies one or more files to a group of hosts from a system. Since the file contents to copy may be different for each host, a separate directory on this system is used for the source files for each host. This can also be used in conjunction with ethuploadall to upload a host-specific configuration file, edit it for each host, and download the new version to all the hosts.
.PP

.B NOTE:
The tool ethdownloadall can only copy from this system to a group of hosts in the cluster. To copy files from hosts in the cluster to this host, use ethuploadall.


.SH Syntax
ethdownloadall [-rp] [-f  \fIhostfile\fR] [-d  \fIdownload\(uldir\fR] [-h \[aq]\fIHOSTS\fR\[aq]]
.br
[-u  \fIuser\fR]
source\(ulfile ...  \fIdest\(ulfile\fR
.SH Options

.TP 10

.TP 10
-r

Performs recursive download of directories.

.TP 10
-p

Performs copy in parallel on all hosts.

.TP 10
-f \fIhostfile\fR

Specifies the file with hosts in cluster. Default is /etc/eth-tools/hosts.

.TP 10
-d \fIdownload\(uldir\fR

Specifies the directory to download files from. Default is downloads. If not specified, the environment variable \fBDOWNLOADS\(ulDIR\fR is used. If that is not exported, the default is used.

.TP 10
-h \fIHOSTS\fR

Specifies the list of hosts to download files to.

.TP 10
-u \fIuser\fR

Specifies the user to perform the copy. Default is the current user code.

.B NOTE:
The user@ style syntax cannot be used in the arguments to ethdownloadall.


.TP 10
\fIsource\(ulfile\fR

Specifies the list of source files to copy from the system.

.IP
The option  \fIsource\(ulfile\fR is relative to  \fIdownload\(uldir\fR/\fIhostname\fR. A local directory within \fIdownload\(uldir\fR/ must exist for each host being downloaded to. Each downloaded file is copied from  \fIdownload\(uldir\fR/\fIhostname\fR/\fIsource\(ulfile\fR.
.TP 10
\fIdest\(ulfile\fR

Specifies the name of the file or directory on the destination hosts to copy to.

.IP
If more than one source file is specified, \fIdest\(ulfile\fR is treated as a directory name. The given directory must already exist on the destination host. The copy fails for hosts where the directory does not exist.
.SH Example
ethdownloadall -h \[aq]arwen elrond\[aq] irqbalance vncservers /etc
.br

# Copies two files to 2 hosts
.br


.br

ethdownloadall -p irqbalance vncservers /etc
.br

# Copies two files to all hosts
