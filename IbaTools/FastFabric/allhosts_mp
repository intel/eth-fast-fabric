# [ICS VERSION STRING: unknown]
# This file lists the TCP/IP names of ALL the hosts in the given plane.
# THIS SHOULD INCLUDE THE NODE RUNNING FASTFABRIC
#
# Each line may specify a single host, a comment or another host list file to
# include. You should augment a hostname with a list of network interfaces to
# specify the interfaces specific to the given plane. For example,
#   host1:eth2,eth3
# If no network interfaces defined for a host, all available interfaces on the
# host will be considered as part of the plane.
# A host shall appear only in one line. If there are multiple occurrences,
# FastFabric will use the last one.
#
# This file will be used by FastFabric to indicate which hosts should be
# operated on by various fastfabric menus and CLI commands.

# it can be useful to include the hosts file for 1 plane, but if enabled the
# hosts file should also specify the network interfaces for each host.
#include /etc/eth-tools/hosts
# if line above is uncommented, add line below with TCP/IP name of FastFabric
# host (eg. this host)
