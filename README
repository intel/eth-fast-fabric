Intel Ethernet tools and Fast Fabric
-------------------------

* To build source and binary packages:

  1. build_package.sh

  This will build the eth-tools-basic and eth-tools-fastfabric packages
  in either of:
     $HOME/rpmbuild/RPMS/(architecture)/ (for RH/SLES)
     or
     $HOME/debbuild (for Ubuntu)

  This will also create debug info package(s), which by default contain(s) basic symbol
  information - see below on how to build with full debugging information.

* How to include debugging symbols:

  export BUILD_CONFIG=debug

  prior to the aforementioned build procedure.
